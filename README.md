* **cordova-plugin-splashscreen** - This plugin is required to work with splash screens. This plugin displays and hides a splash screen during application launch.
* **cordova-plugin-statusbar** - Used to customize the iOS and Android StatusBar, alter the appearance of the status bar (color/style).
* **ionic-plugin-keyboard** - It provides functions to make interacting with the keyboard easier, and fires events to indicate that the keyboard will hide/show.
* **cordova-plugin-inappbrowser** - Provides a web browser view. It could be used to open images, access web pages, and open PDF files.
* **cordova-plugin-geolocation** - Grab the current location of the user, or grab continuous location changes.
* **de.appplant.cordova.plugin.email-composer** - The plugin provides access to the standard interface that manages the editing and sending an email message (https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer.git#0.8.2).
